 ### Compile Instructions

**Step 1:** Open a split terminal, or have two separate terminals, both in the correct path (Starting Directory in Homework1) 

**Step 2:** Run the command to compile c++ files: 
`g++ ./src/consumer.cpp -o ./compiled/consumer; g++ ./src/producer.cpp -o ./compiled/producer`
 
 **Step 3:** 
 **Run the producer first in either terminal:**
  `./compiled/producer`
 **In the other terminal, start the consumer: **
 `./compiled/consumer`

And so, the output will be the resulting input from the producer file. Examples of proper execution include the following:
